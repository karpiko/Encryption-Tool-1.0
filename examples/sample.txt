This is a sample text file for encryption demonstrations.

The File Encryption/Decryption Tool supports multiple encryption algorithms:

1. FERNET (Recommended for most use cases)
   - Symmetric encryption (same key for encrypt/decrypt)
   - Based on AES-128 with HMAC authentication
   - Simple and secure
   - Fast performance

2. AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard)
   - Symmetric encryption with 256-bit keys
   - CBC mode with PKCS7 padding
   - Suitable for large files
   - Military-grade security

3. RSA (Asymmetric encryption)
   - Public/private key pair system
   - Public key for encryption, private key for decryption
   - Limited to small files (~190 bytes with 2048-bit key)
   - Useful for key exchange

Example Usage:
1. Generate encryption key: python main.py generate-key --algorithm fernet --output mykey.key
2. Encrypt file: python main.py encrypt --algorithm fernet --input sample.txt --output sample.txt.enc --key mykey.key
3. Decrypt file: python main.py decrypt --algorithm fernet --input sample.txt.enc --output sample_decrypted.txt --key mykey.key

Remember: Keep your keys safe! Store them in secure locations and never share them.
